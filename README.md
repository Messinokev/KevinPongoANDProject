# KevinPongoANDProject

The motivation behind my project is, that I like keeping track of my  expenditures. I always do this in an excel file, so it is a good opportunity to make an app for it. 

The app is about saving money for a trip, for a car, or anything the user wants to save for. The user can create a goal with a budget, so how much money is needed, and the user can set a time period, when the user wants to achieve this goal. The app can show how much money the user should save per day, per week, or per month. Also, a user can invite others to achieve a goal together. In this case there will be a leader board what shows who put the most money in the goal.

The app also has another side, where the user can set a budget planner, for instance how much money the user thinks to spend in a specific time period. The app shows how much money the user can spend in average/day to keep the limit. The user can add daily costs, so the app shows that the leftover money in average/day is more or less than the average/day what the user should spend. It is also possibly to create different categories, for example: food&beverage, entertainment, shopping, transportation, friends&lover, bills&utilities, subscriptions.

Must have:
- [x] As a user I want to be able to create a goal with a budget what I want to save my money for, so that I can see the progress of  how much money is missing for my goal.
- [x] As a user I want to be able to set a time period for my goal, so that I can see when I would like to achieve my goal.
- [x] As a user I want to be able to create my budget planner and set the budget I plan to spend on a specific category, so that I can keep track of how much money I can spend on a specific category.
- [x] As a user I want to be able to set a specific time period for my budget planner, so that I can keep track of how much money I can spend in average.

Should have:
- [x]	As a user I want to be able to deposit money for my goal, so that I can help achieving it.
- [x]	As a user I want to be able to add my daily costs to the budget planner, so that I can see that I am above or below the average limit.
- [x]	As a user I want to see how much money I should save per day, per week, per month or per year for my goal, so that I can know how much money I should save to achieve my goal.
- [x]	As a user I want to be able to see how much money I can spend in average in a day, so that I can keep track of how much money I can spend in average of my budget planner.
- [x]  As a user I want to delete my goal, so that I can delete the already achieved goal or the goal I do not want to achieve anymore
- [x]  As a user I want to delete my budget planner, so that I can create a new one.
- [x] As a user I want to be able to see how much money I put and on which day, so that I can keep track of my deposit history.

Could have:
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to manage my goal, so that I can keep it up to date.
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to manage my budget planner, so that I can keep it up to date.
