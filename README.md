# KevinPongoANDProject

The motivation behind my project is, that I like keeping track of my  expenditures. I always do this in an excel file, so it is a good opportunity to make an app for it. 

The app is about saving money for a trip, for a car, or anything the user wants to save for. The user can create a goal with a budget, so how much money is needed, and the user can set a time period, when the user wants to achieve this goal. The app can show how much money the user should save per day, per week, or per month. Also, a user can invite others to achieve a goal together. In this case there will be a leader board what shows who put the most money in the goal.

The app also has another side, where the user can set a budget planner, for instance how much money the user thinks to spend in a specific time period. The app shows how much money the user can spend in average/day to keep the limit. The user can add daily costs, so the app shows that the leftover money in average/day is more or less than the average/day what the user should spend. It is also possibly to create different categories, for example: food&beverage, entertainment, shopping, transportation, friends&lover, bills&utilities, subscriptions.
